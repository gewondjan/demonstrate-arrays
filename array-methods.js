/*

The "push" method

1. What does it do? make sure to explain all the parameters. If it has a function as a parameter, make sure to explain all of the parameters for that function.
    The push method appends a value to the end of an array.  It takes any value as a parameter that you would like to append to the end of your array.

2. Does it edit the current array?
    YES, the current array is editted.

3. What does it return?
    The push method returns the new length of the array (the length of the array with the appended value)

4.    How can I use this? Come up (not one off the internet) with a small real world example and explain it.
    I might want to have an array for the number of students in a class and need to add a student who adds the class

5. Build your real world example.
    see example below: need to change the name.
